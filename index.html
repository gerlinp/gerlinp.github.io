                        Hello! My name is Gerlin and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. I'm a self taught developer, who switched from a career in IT, and for as long as I can remember I've always had an interest in tech — While always having to assist clients in fixing and guiding them with programs got me more interested in buidling them to make better experiences.

                        Fast forward to today I've had the privelege of working for a <a href="https://www.salsify.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital management platform</a> as a software engineer CO-OP — Was selected for a <a href="https://www.hackdiversity.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fellowship</a> that gave me the tools and resources to make me a better developer while also helping to bridge the gap between the technology industry and underrepresented individuals. And contributed to <a href="https://github.com/codeforboston/maple" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">civic tech groups</a> to be able help, and improve the way goverment and community organizations serve the public by using technology.
